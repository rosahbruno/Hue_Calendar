# Hue_Calendar
Hue Calendar application for Android devices 

This application was developed in CS 300 Software Engineering at Juniata College. It is an application that fuses both a calendar and a way to automate Philips Hue Lights. It allows you to enter your schedule into the application and from that schedule when your house lights should be on or off. The app is able to connect to multiple lights in the same house and works as long as both are running on the same network.
